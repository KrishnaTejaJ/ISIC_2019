# Skin Lesion Analysis towards Melanoma Detection with Deep Neural Network (ISIC 2019)
Skin cancer detection and classification is one of the biggest challenges faced by the medical industry. The automation process of solving this problem can by done using the concept of Convolution Neural Networks in Deep Learning. The basic objective is to design a reliable and effective method for determination of melanoma, the deadliest skin malignancy. In addition to fine-tuning and data augmentation, experimententation is done on many pre-trained models like InceptionResNetV2, ResNet, MobileNet, NASNet and VGG16.

The data that being used is provided by ISIC as a part of their 2019 challenge. The dataset contains a total images of 25,331 images of 8 different catogories namely Melanoma, Melanocytic nevus, Basal cell carcinoma, Actinic keratosis, Benign keratosis (solar lentigo / seborrheic, keratosis / lichen planus-like keratosis), Dermatofibroma, Vascular lesion and Squamous cell carcinoma.

Transfer Learning along with data augmentation the two techniques used in the process of developing the mechanism for the task of ISIC 2019.
